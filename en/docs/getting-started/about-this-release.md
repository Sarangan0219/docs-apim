## What is new in this release

The **WSO2 API Manager 3.2.0** is the **latest** **WSO2 API Manager release** and is the successor of **WSO2 API Manager 3.1.0**. It contains the following new features and enhancements:

### WSO2 API-M related new features

- **[Third-party Key Manager support]({{base_path}}/administer/key-managers/overview/)**

     WSO2 API Manager provides an admin functionality for admins or tenant admins to configure different authorization servers as Key Managers. This brings the capability of supporting multiple Key Managers for a given API.

- **[Approval Workflow Executor to API Manager]({{base_path}}/learn/consume-api/manage-application/advanced-topics/adding-an-application-creation-workflow/)**

     The Approval Workflow Executor can be enabled for application creation, subscription creation, application key generation, user self sign up, and API state change.

- **[API Publisher Test Console]({{base_path}}/learn/design-api/create-api/test-a-rest-api/)**

     The new Test Console in the API Publisher allows you to try out APIs from the Publisher itself and verify functions and behaviors before publishing them to the Gateway for subscribers.

- **[GraphQL query complexity analysis]({{base_path}}/learn/rate-limiting/graphql-api/query-complexity-limitation/#adding-a-new-subscription-policy-with-graphql-max-complexity-value)**

     You can request more data with increased flexibility using GraphQL queries. WSO2 API Manager introduces the Static Query Analyser to handle complex queries. 

- **OAuth 2.0 endpoint security**

     APIs created in WSO2 API Manager can directly access OAuth 2.0-protected endpoints without any extension to WSO2 API Manager.

- **Horizontal pod auto-scaling with custom-metrics in the K8s API-Operator**

     You can now auto-scale backend or managed API horizontally based on custom metrics. For more information, see the [sample scenario (v1.2.0)](https://github.com/wso2/k8s-api-operator/tree/master/scenarios/scenario-20) with detailed configurations in the GitHub page of the K8s API-Operator.

- **[Private Jet mode for Microgateways]({{base_path}}/learn/api-microgateway/deploy-apis-in-privatejet-mode/)**

     WSO2 API Manager now provides cloud-native API management, where users can expose microservices as managed APIs in cloud environments with the support of the K8s API-Operator.

- **[Gateway Runtime Artifact Synchronizer]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/distributed-deployment/configuring-multi-gateway-setup-with-artifact-synchronization)**

     This feature allows you to sync nodes seamlessly in a Multi-Gateway setup using NFS with an extension point that can be configured to store these Synapse artifacts. 

- **[Git integration support for API Controller]({{base_path}}/learn/api-controller/ci-cd-with-wso2-api-management/)**

     From API Manager 3.2 onwards, the API Controller can operate on top of a Git repository and identify all the APIs/API Products and application projects that are committed to it. It provides a single command to detect and deploy all the projects to the given environment.

- **Support for API products from API Controller**

     WSO2 API Manager enables users to utilize not only HTTP/REST endpoints but also HTTP/SOAP endpoints with endpoint routing policies such as load balancing and failover. In addition, this incorporates support for dynamic endpoints and AWS Lambda endpoints as well.

- **API lifecycle status change support**

     API lifecycle status change support in WSO2 API Controller 3.2 provides users the ability to modify the lifecycle status of an API easily without accessing the Publisher UI. 

- **API/application delete support for controller**

     WSO2 API Controller 3.2 provides the ability to delete an API/application using a single command, allowing users to easily remove an unwanted API or application in an environment without signing in to the Publisher or Developer Portal.

- **[API key authentication support for API Operator]({{base_path}}/learn/api-security/api-authentication/secure-apis-using-api-keys/#api-key-restriction-for-ip-address-and-http-referer)**

     API key authentication support in API Operator provides a simple authentication scheme that accepts a valid self-contained JWT token issued for accessing APIs.

- **[API key restriction for IP and referrer]({{base_path}}/learn/api-security/api-authentication/secure-apis-using-api-keys/#api-key-restriction-for-ip-address-and-http-referer)**

     Ability to define authorized parties when generating a token using an IP address restriction or a HTTP referer restriction.

### WSO2 API-M Analytics related new features

- **Monitoring Dashboard**

      Having an idea about the overall health status of APIs and services is essential for the proper functioning of an API-driven business. The Monitoring Dashboard helps to achieve this objective by showing contextual information on APIs such as latency, throughput, errors, and traffic volume. Operational and management users can use this dashboard to identify operational errors, narrow down the root cause, or to identify common traffic trends. The overview page provides a holistic view by aggregating different views on APIs, and by using the drill-downs user can get a detailed picture of different perspectives. 

- **Re-organized Analytics dashboards**
        
      Significant changes have been done on the Publisher Analytics Dashboard to improve the experience of different audiences. The newly available Business Analytics Dashboard has been created by combining several new widgets with the widgets that initially existed in the Publisher Analytics Dashboard to provide an unrestricted view on the APIs for Managerial users. A user with an *internal/analytics* role can access the new dashboard to view the statistics for all APIs irrespective of whether those APIs are access-controlled or not. Further, a specific set of widgets chosen from the Publisher Analytics Dashboard has been used to create an API Analytics Dashboard, which now shows a limited set of Statistics relevant to a Publisher. A Publisher can use this dashboard to view the statistics of APIs created by them or visible to them.
      The Developer portal Dashboard has been renamed to the Application Analytics Dashboard and the Admin Dashboard has been renamed to Reports Dashboard, to reflect their functionality better.
                                                                         
- **Exporting data in CSV, PDF formats**
    
      This new feature is introduced to widgets in order to export data as a CSV or PDF. It supports all the widgets with tabular data. Users can export the current view and can share, analyze, or compare it with different views. It helps to export custom or selected data sets.
      
- **New alert page in Monitoring Dashboards**

      As information related to API availability and alert listing is more related to analytics, it has been moved to the Monitoring Dashboard from the API Manager Admin Portal. It provides an overview of the API availability and filtering based on the availability status. The alert listing widgets have additional improvements to provide filtering and better API-wise comparison. Interactive widgets are provided and support to narrow down alerts.

- **New summary charts for monitoring dashboards**

      Summarised information of the API requests is present in these widgets. There are 4 summary widgets to depict the total API invocation count, faulty count, throttled out request count, and highest API latency time within the last 24 hours. These widgets help to identify the above parameters of the system and it also allows users to do a drill-down analysis on appropriate widgets in order to narrow down the issues.


## What has changed in this release

### Improvements to existing WSO2 API-M features

- **Scope management**

     Adds more improvements for this by supporting shared scopes per tenant and allowing multiple scopes to be attached to each API resource.

- **Revamped Admin Portal UI**

     WSO2 API Manager’s Admin Portal has got a whole new and exciting look with the use of ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The new Admin Portal UI clearly defines the administrative tasks that can be performed, and it also makes the workflows of API administrators simple and more efficient. It has a dashboard view that shows the summary of the administrative tasks and any pending workflow approvals. This makes it easier for administrators to keep track of pending or already-performed tasks. Similar to the Publisher and Developer Portal, the Admin Portal is a OAuth2.0 client application, which authenticates to the WSO2 API Manager’s backend via Open ID Connect. Users now have the ability to customize and enhance the look and feel of the Admin Portal by extending the React components in the portal. 

- **Accessibility compliance of the Developer Portal**
  
     WSO2 API Manager’s Developer Portal now conforms to the Level A and Level AA success criteria of the conformance requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1).  This will make content more accessible to a wider range of people.

- **Subscription upgrade**

     The subscription tier upgrade feature provides the capability to change the subscription tier of an already existing subscription without having to delete the subscription and resubscribe to the same API.

- **In-Memory Subscription**

     The In-Memory Subscription provides validation support to remove runtime dependencies between the Gateway and the Key Manager node and validates the request by accessing the metadata in the In-Memory data store. As a result, WSO2 API Manager can serve the request even in a situation where the database is inaccessible.

- **Mock Response Payload Generation for API Prototyping**
 
     The Mock Response Payload Generation has been improved to allow API Publishers to generate complex inline scripts. This offers consumers the flexibility to obtain any response that is supported by a particular resource of the API. Furthermore, the publishers and consumers no longer have to face the limitation of being able to define and retrieve only a single response per resource.

- **Support for Public Certificate Installation for Secure HTTP Communication for the Controller**

     Ability to import SSL certificates related to WSO2 API Manager that are used in different environments. Certificates that are trusted by the operating system, which includes certificates of different Certificate Authority (CA), will be imported by default. If there are any additional certificates needed for controller operations of different environments, they can be imported manually. As a result, any DER or PEM encoded certificates can be imported.

- **Improve Search for an API / Application in Controller**

     WSO2 API Controller 3.2 allows users to search for APIs, applications, or API products during the listing process, which can be searched by name, version, provider, context, status, description, subcontext, doc, and label with `-q` or `--query` optional flag.

### Deprecated features and functionalities

- Local scopes

     The local scopes feature allows users to create per API scopes locally. Even though the local scope usage is limited to the API that it belongs to, the same scope key cannot be used for a local scope of any other API. Local scopes are created and updated in the Key Manager; thereby, making the number of Key Manager calls comparatively high. Therefore, this feature provides inferior support during scope update and scope validation when used across multiple versions of the same API. 
     
     From API Manager 3.2 onwards, it is recommended to use the [shared scopes]({{base_path}}/learn/api-security/oauth2/oauth2-scopes/fine-grained-access-control-with-oauth-scopes/#shared-scopes) feature to create scopes per tenant and share them across multiple APIs in the tenant. Shared scopes will address these limitations by sharing the same scope across multiple APIs (including multiple versions of the same API) while making the management of scopes separate from API creation/update.

- Cross tenant Subscription

- [Admin Portal](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/3.2.0/develop/product-apis/admin-apis/admin-v0.17/admin-v0.17/) v0.17 based REST APIs.

### Removed features and functionalities

- Tag wise grouping

     API categories are used for API grouping, similar to Tag wise grouping. However, the user does not have to go through the hassle of following a naming convention when creating API categories. Therefore, with the introduction of the API categories, the Tag wise grouping feature has been removed. 

- [Developer Portal](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/3.1.0/develop/product-apis/devportal-apis/devportal-v0.16/devportal-v0.16/), [Publisher](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/3.1.0/develop/product-apis/publisher-apis/publisher-v0.16/publisher-v0.16/), and [Admin Portal](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/3.1.0/develop/product-apis/admin-apis/admin-v0.16/admin-v0.16/) v0.16 based REST APIs.

- Developer Portal and Publisher v0.17 based REST APIs.
